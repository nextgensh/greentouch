1. When the delays are calculated if ShouldISwitch() returns
   a false for an LTE spike then that means the delay encoutered
   in that case will be less that 1.5 seconds. I have modified
   the code to reflect this, so now the delay in this instance
   will be calculated as (data/lib.Bandwidth_3g). Not a big
   difference in the end result as only one instance of the delay
   changes from 1.5 to 1.36.
